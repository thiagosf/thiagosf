### Howdy ðŸ––

My name is **Thiago**, I've been working on web development since 2007, I really like to craft experiences to **end-users** and developers to consume **APIâ€™s** without pain.

I was born and live in **Brazil**, most of my knowledge I learned from the **open source community**, therefore I'm very grateful and I try to give back in some way ðŸ˜Š.
